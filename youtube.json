                    "description": "SHAED: Once Upon A Time (Official VR 180° Music Video)\nListening to @SHAED 's, \"Once Upon a Time,\" in the midst of the most chaotic year in recent memory was like a breath of fresh air. The track is so human and accessible. We've all had a first love and felt the intensity that goes along with it. Even though those memories can be painful, \"Once Upon a Time\" invites you to explore them in a safe place, transported by a serene melody and fantastical instrumentation.\nAesthetically, we wanted to ground the video somewhere that matched our comfort while listening to the song. We developed a queer adaptation of the postwar, Ozzie and Harriet aesthetic. In this space, we reveled in the curl-your-toes excitement of young love and examined the pitfalls of trying to love someone while navigating the social constructs and identities. The dancers and choreography shift between gender roles, combining ballet and contemporary dance with sharp isolated movements and everyday gestures. This VR music video offers a level of intimacy not felt in traditional film and theater, so we played with that by juxtaposing moments of almost interactive closeups with more conventional choreography. All in all, this immersive experience, like the song, invites viewers to feel for something lost while still appreciating its beauty.\n\n➡️Watch on Oculus TV with Oculus Quest 2: https://ocul.us/3niVtYa\n\nstream/download:\nhttps://shaed.lnk.to/onceuponatime\n\nCreative Director: Morgan Embry\nAssistant Director: Keeley Turner\nDirector/DP: Xiaoyu Hugh Hou\nLighting Design: Lee Duck\nAssistant Camera: Keeley Turner\nVFX: Jan Boria\nVR Tech Advisor: Brent Schnarr / Oculus Media \nChoreographer: Koryn Ann Wicks\nSet Design: Zachary Titus\nCostume Design: Lauryn Terceira\nPerformers: Morgan Embry / Koryn Ann Wicks\n\nProduced by CreatorUp & Ducklights\nCamera by Oculus \n\nLyrics: \nOnce upon a time\nWe were gonna fall in love\nWe were so sure\nBlinded by the stars above\n\nI tried and tried to warn you, \nThat I could fall apart\n\nAll of my walls came crashing down on you\nYou can't save me\nAll of my walls came crashing down on you\nYou can't change me\n\nOnce upon a time\nWe were gonna have a life\nHad the car running \nAll you had to do was drive\n\nI tried and tried to love you, \nBut I wasn't brave enough\n\nAll of my walls came crashing down on you\nYou can't save me\nAll of my walls came crashing down on you\nYou can't change me\n\n#VR180 #SHAED #OnceUponATime",

Was everything you ever did without purpose and never really mattered, or will you just stop existing after you take your last breath? Think about this, it is the most important question of your life. There is only one chance to get it right, and it is in this lifetime. Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap. Heaven is real, place of eternal bliss. Hell is real, place of eternal torment. You&#39;re gonna spend eternity in one of those places. God&#39;s will is, that nobody would perish. One day every single one of us has to stand before the Holy Righteous God to be judged, and to give an account how we have lived our life. The only way to get to Heaven is if you are without sin, and every single one of us has sinned. That is why God in His love and mercy sent His only begotten Son, Jesus Christ, to atone for our sins. He left Heaven’s Throne, was God in flesh, conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of a virgin, lived a holy perfect sinless life, was condemned unjustly to death while being innocent, was beaten, mocked, flogged, and crucified on the cross, and gave up His life and Blood willingly on our behalf, for there is no forgiveness of sins without the shedding of blood, but Christ, the spotless and unblemished Lamb of God, the Perfect Sacrifice once and for all, died for us, so we may be forgiven of all our sins, and be redeemed back to God, after the fall in Paradise by satan&#39;s tempting, through the Holy Precious Blood, which Jesus shed on the middle cross at Calvary, in His everlasting love towards every single one of us.<br> <br>If you truly repent and ask for forgiveness of your sins from Jesus Christ, and believe with all your heart, that Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God, was crucified, died on the cross, was buried, rose from the dead by God’s power on the third day according to the Scriptures, and by faith receive Him as your Lord and Savior, through the Royal Blood of Jesus Christ you will be saved, and are born again of the Holy Spirit. Every sin that weighs you down, even the ones you never dare to speak of, will be forgiven. Repent, believe, follow Christ, and you will spend eternity in Heaven with our Holy King, where is no more death, sorrow, pain nor crying.<br> <br>John 3:16 - For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son (Jesus Christ), that whoever believes in Him, shall not perish, but have everlasting life.<br> <br>John 14:6 - Jesus said unto him, “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father (to Heaven) except through Me.“<br> <br>Book of Acts 4:12 - Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under Heaven given among men (only Jesus Christ), whereby we must be saved.<br> <br>Romans 10:9-10 - That if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart, that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.<br> <br>Romans 10:13 - For whosoever shall call upon the name of the LORD (Jesus Christ), shall be saved.<br> <br>Romans 8:1-2 - Therefore, there is now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus (born again of the Holy Spirit), who walk not after the flesh, but after the (Holy) Spirit. For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death.<br> <br>1 Timothy 2:5 - For there is one God and one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus.<br> <br>Ephesians 2:8-9 - For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.<br> <br>Isaiah 1:18 - Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.<br> <br>John 10:10 – (Jesus said:) “The thief (satan) cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.“<br> <br>1 Peter 5:8 - Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour.<br> <br>Ephesians 6:12 - For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.<br> <br>The LORD bless you and keep you; The LORD make His face shine upon you, and be gracious to you; The LORD lift up His countenance upon you, and give you peace.<br> <br>In Jesus Christ Holy and Mighty Name.
